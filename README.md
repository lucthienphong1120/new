## Credits
eDEX-UI's source code was primarily written by me, [Squared](https://github.com/GitSquared). If you want to get in touch with me or find other projects I'm involved in, check out [my website](https://gaby.dev).

[PixelyIon](https://github.com/PixelyIon) helped me get started with Windows compatibility and offered some precious advice when I started to work on this project seriously.

[IceWolf](https://soundcloud.com/iamicewolf) composed the sound effects on v2.1.x and above. He makes really cool stuff, check out his music!

This project uses a bunch of open-source libraries, frameworks and tools, see [the full dependency graph](https://github.com/GitSquared/edex-ui/network/dependencies).
